# Braneworld-extra-dimensions

This repository contains a set of results and tools to reproduce the results from:

L. Visinelli, N. Bolis, S. Vagnozzi, [Brane-world extra dimensions in light of GW170817](https://inspirehep.net/record/1636969), [arXiv: 1711.06628](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.06628) (VBV17)

where constraints on the size of the AdS<sub>5</sub> radius of curvature within the [Randall-Sundrum brane-world model](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.83.4690) are placed in light of the near-simultaneous detection of the gravitational wave event GW170817 and its optical counterpart, the short Î³-ray burst event GRB170817A ([Astrophys.J. 848 (2017) no.2, L13](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/aa920c/meta)). The content of the folders is described below.

## montepython

This folder contains a patch to the [Montepython](https://github.com/baudren/montepython_public) cosmological MCMC sampler to sample the posterior distribution of the 4-dimensional parameter space in VBV17 and obtain constraints on the parameters.

The GW170817_braneworld/ folder implements the likelihood (Eq.(19) in VBV17), hence the name of the experiment you want to use in your run is "GW170817_braneworld" as per Montepython's philosophy. You should copy this folder into your montepython/montepython/likelihoods folder. You should also copy the contents of the covmat/ folder into your montepython/covmat folder (assuming you want to supply an input covariance matrix to your runs, which is recommended).

The input .param file to do the MCMC run is braneworld.param
