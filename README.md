where constraints on the size of the AdS<sub>5</sub> radius of curvature within the Randall-Sundrum brane-world model are placed in light of the near-simultaneous detection of the gravitational wave event GW170817 and its optical counterpart, the short Î³-ray burst event GRB170817A [Astrophys.J. 848 (2017) no.2, L13](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/aa920c/meta)
